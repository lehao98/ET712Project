  <p> <h2> <u>&nbsp &nbsp Hello, My name is Jason Ruan. And I am a QCC student, this is my last year in QCC and I am close to graudate from the college. Hopefully, I should be graduate as soon as possible. My major is Internet Information Technology because I love doing with pragramming and doing with computer working. And my future is to become a website designer, so this class is one of the class that required. Finally, I would be working more harder in this class. </u> </h2> </p>
